firstStepTitle=Welcome
firstStepMessage=This wizard is to help you use our Portal For IoT BPMN Graphical Editor. \n In this walkthrough, we will guide in applying a simple application in order to demonstrate the use of this portal.
firstStepText=In this first step, let's discover the context and the requirements you need to be able to realize your application at the end. \n So, we will be doing a simple application where a Raspberry Pi 3 card is connected to a temperature sensor. \n According to the temperature measured, a LED will give a signal. \n Make sure that you dispose of these materials please: \n - Raspberry Pi 3 \n - Temperature sensor DS18B20 \n - A 4.7 kÎ© resistor \n - LED \n - Breadboard \n - Jumper wire \n - Memory card (of at least 8 GB)  

secondStepTitle=Choose your IoT devices
secondStepText=In this step, you will check the IoT devices you need. \n 
secondStepText2=Now, make sure that you wire your composants as shown in this schematic. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 

thirdStepTitle=Configure your devices
thirdStepText1=Make sure that Raspbian is already installed in your Raspberry Pi. \n In this step, you need to configure your Raspberry Pi. \n First of all, instal those packages \n 
thirdStepMessage1=sudo apt-get update \n sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-openssl git \n
thirdStepText2=We are going to use the Adafruit library \n
thirdStepMessage2= git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git && cd Adafruit_Python_DHT \n sudo python setup.py install  \n 
thirdStepText3=Now, run this (Replace pin by the number of the pin in which your teperature sensor is wired) \n
thirdStepMessage3=sudo ./AdafruitDHT.py 11 pin \n
thirdStepText4=You need to download this file and run it. \n


forthStepTitle=Test your application
forthStepText=Now, let's test the application. Do as follows.
